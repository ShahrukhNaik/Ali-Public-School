                    <p class="card-text">
                    Kids learn in different ways and at different paces. Personalized learning is a teaching model based on that premise. Each student gets a “learning plan” based on how they learn, what they know, and what their skills and interests are. It’s the opposite of the “one size fits all” approach.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">Students work with their teachers to set both short-term and long-term goals. This process helps students take ownership of their learning.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">Teachers make sure learning plans or project-based learning match up with academic standards. And they check to see if students are demonstrating the skills they’re expected to learn as they progress through their education.</p>
                    <p class="card-text">Personalized learning is not a replacement for special education. It’s an approach to general education that can work with an Individualized Education Program.</p>

                    <h4 class="card-title">Role of Teacher's</h4>
                    <p class="card-text">It is not an exaggeration to say that a great teacher can change a student’s life. There are an endless amount of great teacher stories that attest to the benefits of a strong relationship between an educator and pupil.</p>                    
                    <p class="card-text">Teachers can also be a trusted source of advice for students weighing important life decisions. Educators can help their pupils pursue higher education, explore career opportunities and compete in events they might otherwise have not thought themselves able to. Students often look to their teachers as mentors with experience and knowledge, and, as an educator, you will almost definitely be asked for advice at some point during your career.</p>
